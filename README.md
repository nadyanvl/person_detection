## Dataset

This project utilizes a subset of the [COCO-2017](https://docs.voxel51.com/user_guide/dataset_zoo/datasets.html#dataset-zoo-coco-2017) dataset provided by FiftyOne. The dataset has been downsampled to include a total of 5000 instances, distributed as follows:
- 4000 for training
- 500 for validation
- 500 for testing

For detailed information about the original dataset, you can refer to the [COCO-2017 documentation](https://cocodataset.org/#home).

In this project, we focus exclusively on the `person` class in object detection.
